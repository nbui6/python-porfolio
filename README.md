# Instacart Basket Analysis
This repo is analyzing grocery purchase behavior using Instacart data. The goal was to explore customer patterns and figure out how Instacart could do better marketing by targeting the right people with the right products.

# What’s in here
Python notebooks with all my data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis
Visualizations to show trends (bar charts, histograms, etc.)
Customer segmentation and profile analysis
A final report with recommendations for the sales & marketing teams

# What I looked into
When people order most (time of day, day of week)
When they spend the most
Which products and departments are most popular
Price ranges and simplified groupings
Customer loyalty and differences across regions
Behavior differences across age, income, family status

# Purpose
Instacart wants to send smarter ads and offers—so this analysis helps them know who’s buying what, when, and how often. That way they can stop sending diaper coupons to single 20-year-olds and start recommending high-value stuff to loyal users at the right time.

# Tech used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebooks
Excel (for final summary)
Instacart 2017 open dataset + fabricated customer data
